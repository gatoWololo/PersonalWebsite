## About Me

<img src="/resources/aboutme/omar.jpg"	title="Omar" width="250" height="250" style="float:right"/>

My name is **Omar S. Navarro Leija**. I am a graduating Computer Science PhD at the University Of Pennsylvania advised by [Prof. Joseph Devietti](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~devietti/).

I am a systems researcher with expertise in the Rust programming language, the Linux programming interface, and systems programming.


## Looking For Job üëÅ

I am graduating August 2022 and planning to transition into industry. I am seeking software engineering jobs, primarily programming in Rust. I am passionate about engineering software solutions to interesting technical problems. I am interested in all levels of the software stack. Feel free to contact me!

**My CV can be found [here](/resources/aboutme/omar_resume.pdf)**.

I can be contacted via the email on my [Github Profile](https://github.com/gatoWololo).

## Research Interests

I am broadly interested in Linux systems programming, operating systems, and Rust ü¶Ä. Other interests include: deterministic program execution, kernel bypass technologies, record-replay systems, concurrency, GPUs, virtual machines, and functional programming.

My doctoral research leverages deterministic program execution for solving various software problems. For example, in [Reproducible Containers](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3373376.3378519) we create a container abstraction where all computation is guaranteed to be determinstic. This enables automatic [reproducible builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/).

See all publications [here](/publications/main).

## Teaching
I am highly interested in computer science education. I have strong opinions about how programming is taught. So I'm doing something about it! I have taught UPenn's _CIS198 Rust Programming_ Fall 2018, Fall 2019. This course strongly focuses on:
- Understanding what a systems language is and motivating Rust via the shortcomings of C and C++.
- Understanding the design and performance trade-offs of Rust vs other languages (static types, garbage collection, zero cost abstraction, etc).
- Good software engineering practices (e.g. testing, robust error handling, and writing idiomatic, maintainable code).
- Understanding not just the language, but the larger language ecosystem (libraries, build tools, programming tools, etc).

For those interested you can see the previous iteration of the [class website](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis198/).
