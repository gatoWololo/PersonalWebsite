## About Me

My name is **Omar S. Navarro Leija**. I am a 5th year CS Doctoral Candidate at the University Of Pennsylvania advised by [Prof. Joseph Devietti](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~devietti/).

## Research Interests

I am broadly interested in systems programming and Rust ü¶Ä. I spend most of my time working with the Linux programming interface and system call APIs (basically, all the things in the highly recommended [TLPI book](https://man7.org/tlpi/)).

I enjoy solving practical, real-world problems and implementing robust software systems. Which doesn't always mesh well with academic interests...

My doctoral research leverages deterministic program execution for solving various software problems. For example, in [Reproducible Containers](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3373376.3378519) we create a container abstraction where all computation is guaranteed to be determinstic. This enables automatic [reproducible builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/).

See all publications [here](/publications/main).

## Looking For Job üëÅ

I wil be graduating Spring/Summer 2022 and planning to transition into industry. I am most interested in engineering or research jobs solving interesting problems with Rust. Feel free to contact me!

My CV can be found [here](/resources/aboutme/omarResumeNoContactInfo.pdf). I can be contacted via the email on my [Github Profile](https://github.com/gatoWololo).

## Teaching
I am highly interested in computer science education. I have strong opinions about how programming is taught. So I'm doing something about it! I have taught UPenn's _CIS198 Rust Programming_ Fall 2018, Fall 2019, and soon Fall 2021. This course strongly focuses on:
- Understanding what a systems language is and motivating Rust via the shortcomings of C and C++.
- Understanding the design and performance trade-offs of Rust vs other languages (static types, garbage collection, zero cost abstraction, etc).
- Good software engineering practices (e.g. testing, robust error handling, and writing idiomatic, maintainable code).
- Understanding not just the language, but the larger language ecosystem (libraries, build tools, programming tools, etc).

For those interested you can see the previous iteration of the [class website](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis198/). For Fall 2021, I hope to record the lectures and create an online Rust course avaliable to anyone.
