## About Me

<img src="/resources/aboutme/omar.jpg"	title="Omar" width="250" height="250" style="float:right"/>

My name is **Omar S. Navarro Leija, PhD**. I combine rigorous software engineering with a researcher mindset
to solve difficult technical problems. I bring expertise in Linux systems programming, with over 7 years experience
with Rust. I am currently living in foggy San Francisco, CA.

I work at Bolt Labs as a senior software engineer developing backend systems for Wallet-as-a-service infrastructure
and implementing our cutting-edge distributed cryptographic protocols software library. I am a passionate Rust 
programmer with advanced knowledge of the language, tooling, best practices, and broader ecosystem.

## Research

In 2022, I completed my PhD at the University Of Pennsylvania advised by [Prof. Joseph Devietti](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~devietti/). I am broadly knowledgeable of:
systems programming, software engineering, programming languages, and operating systems.  

During my doctoral research I enjoyed engineering software systems to solve practical problems in computing. For example, in [Reproducible Containers](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3373376.3378519)
I pioneered a container abstraction for deterministic program execution, this enabled automatic software [reproducible builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/).
Dissertation: [_Leveraging System Call Interposition for Low-level Process Manipulation_](/resources/publications/dissertation.pdf)

Here is long list of concepts and technologies I enjoy thinking about: Program tracing and sandboxing (ptrace, seccomp), containerization,
deterministic program execution, software builds (build systems, reproducible builds, supply chain attacks), developer tooling,
kernel bypass technologies (RDMA, DPDK), virtualization (VMs and hypervisors), programming languages (functional programming, concurrency and parallelism models, compilers),
Cuda and GPUs.

See all publications [here](/publications/main).
