## About Me

My name is **Omar Navarro Leija**. I am a 4th year CS PhD student at the University Of Pennsylvania. I'm part of
the Architecture and Compilers Group, advised by [Joseph Devietti](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~devietti/).

## Work

A doctoral program gives me the freedom to work on fun and challenging engineering questions without worrying about business concerns, and the freedom to try out crazier ideas! **I enjoy building software systems with large emphasis on sound software engineering practices, cool programming languages, and practicality.**

I view [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) as a great step in the right direction. I am lucky enough to implement our research projects in Rust! What more could I ask for in a job?

I plan to graduate Summer 2021. I am looking for systems research engineer or interesting Rust software engineering jobs!

## Research Interests

I seek to answer the question "How can we improve software systems in terms of programmer productivity, maintainability, correctness, and security?"
My research interests lie somewhere in the intersection of **systems programming, operating systems, software engineering, and programming languages.**

You can find my publication history at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pcpWVZwAAAAJ&hl=en)

I like way too many things so I am also highly interested in parallelism and concurrency, virtualization, containerization, compilers, kernel development, GPUs, computer architecture, programming tools, and type-level programming.

## Teaching

I have strong opinions about how CS is taught at the university level. So I'm doing something about it!
For the past Fall 2018, Fall 2019, and soon Fall 2020 semester, I am the instructor for the undergraduate CIS198 Rust Programming course.

My course would be better named Systems Programming in Rust with a strong focus on:
- Understanding what a systems language is and motivating Rust via the shortcomings of C and C++.
- Understanding the design and performance trade-offs of Rust vs other languages (static types, garbage collection, zero cost abstraction, etc).
- Good software engineering practices (e.g. testing, robust error handling, and writing idiomatic, maintainable code).
- Understanding not just the language, but the larger language ecosystem (libraries, build tools, programming tools, etc).

For those interested you can see the previous iteration of the [class website](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis198/).
