## About Me

<img src="/resources/aboutme/omar.jpg"	title="Omar" width="250" height="250" style="float:right"/>

My name is **Omar S. Navarro Leija, PhD**. I am a software engineer and researcher with broad interests in systems programming,
software engineering, programming languages, and operating systems. Currently living in foggy San Francisco, CA.

I work at Bolt Labs as a senior software engineer developing backend systems for Wallet-as-a-service
infrastructure and implementing cryptographic code for threshold-based elliptic curve signing (MPC TSS-ECDSA).

I have over 5 years of experience with the Rust programming language. I consider myself an advanced Rust user, with 
thorough knowledge of the language, tooling, and library ecosystem. 

## Research

In 2022, I completed my PhD at the University Of Pennsylvania advised by [Prof. Joseph Devietti](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~devietti/).

My doctoral research leveraged deterministic program execution for solving various software problems. For example, in [Reproducible Containers](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3373376.3378519)
we create a container abstraction where all computation is guaranteed to be deterministic. This enables automatic [reproducible builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/).

Here is a way too long list of technologies and concepts I have worked with and enjoy thinking about: Program tracing and sandboxing (eBPF, ptrace, seccomp), containerization,
deterministic program execution, concurrency and parallelism, functional programming, developer tools, kernel bypass technologies (RDMA, DPDK), virtualization (VMs and hypervisors), GPUs.

See all publications [here](/publications/main).

Dissertation:
[_Leveraging System Call Interposition for Low-level Process Manipulation_](/resources/publications/dissertation.pdf)
