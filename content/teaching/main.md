## Teaching
I am very interested in programming and computer science education. I have strong opinions about how programming 
should be taught.

### University Teaching
I taught UPenn's _CIS198 Rust Programming_ Fall 2018, Fall 2019. This course strongly focuses on:
- Understanding what a systems language is and motivating Rust via the shortcomings of C and C++.
- Understanding the design and performance trade-offs of Rust vs other languages (static types, garbage collection, zero cost abstraction, etc).
- Good software engineering practices (e.g. testing, robust error handling, and writing idiomatic, maintainable code).
- Understanding not just the language, but the larger language ecosystem (libraries, build tools, programming tools, etc).

### Colorado Gold Rust
I was happy to help co-teach the Rustbridge workshop at Colorado Gold Rust 2019 in Denver, CO!
