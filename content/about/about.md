## Work

I am a 4th year CS PhD student at the University Of Pennsylvania. I'm part of
the Architecture and Compilers Group (ACG), advised by [Joseph Devietti](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~devietti/).

A PhD program gives me the freedom to work on super cool research projects, explore new
technologies, languages, and experimental designs. It's a lot of fun!

You can find my publication history at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pcpWVZwAAAAJ&hl=en)


## Research interests

I am interested in all matters related to systems programming. Mainly, how can we make systems programming easier in terms of productivity, security, and correctness.

Parallelism is increasingly needed to keep up with the demands of software, I focus on methods for easier, portable, and correct parallel and concurrent programming.

I view Rust as the great next step in the right direction! I try to use Rust for our research projects whenever possible!

I'm also very interested in operating systems, compilers, and programming languages.

## Teaching

During Fall 2018 semester, I had the pleasure to teach CIS198: Rust Programming. There
are various resources and notes in the [class website](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis198/),
that people may find useful.

I plan to teach CIS198 again in Fall 2019, with major iterations on the assignments and
class notes!
