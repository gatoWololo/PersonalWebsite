## Work

I'm a third year computer science PhD student at the University Of Pennsylvania. I'm part of
the Architecture and Compilers Group (ACG), advised by [Joseph Devietti](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~devietti/).

A PhD program gives me the freedom to work on super cool research projects, explore new
technologies and experimental designs. It's a lot of fun!

## Research interests

I am interested in all matters related to systems programming. Mainly, how can we make systems programming easier in terms of productiviy, security, and correctness.

As parallelism becomes increasingly needed to keep up with the demands of software, I plan to focus on methods for easier, portable, and correct parallel and concurrent programming.

I view Rust as the great next step in the right direction! I'm excited to program future research projects in Rust.

I'm also very interested in operating systems, compilers, and programming languages (specially the functional kind).

## Teaching

In the past, I have TA UPenn's the graduate Haskell programming class.

For the fall 2018 semester I am beyond excited to teach UPenn's Rust programming course!
